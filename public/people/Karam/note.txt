Dear Sash,
Starting this off with a sorry I’m such a fkn nerd that I literally made you a custom website… I hope you like it!!!
I have loved every second of growing up with you, you’ve genuinely been such an inspiration and role model to me my whole life and I’m so proud of everything you’ve accomplished. I know times are rough right now but I need you to remember just how fucking badass tough-as-nails you are. 
You’re gonna fly, you’re gonna soar next year!!! 💓✈️🚀
Lots and lots and lots of love,
Korm
