Happy birthday sash! 
24 already, getting old (me in less than a month but shh). Looking forward to finally having you back in Perth it’s been too long, need some more yochi sweet treats and 3am chats with Karam where we talk shit.
Better be organising a little outing with the gang when you’re back for an official celebration!
